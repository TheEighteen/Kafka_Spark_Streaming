ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview: Real-time Data Pipeline Implementation

ðŸš€ In this project, I built a robust real-time data pipeline integrating several modern technologies for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and storage.

ðŸ”— Tech Stack & Workflow:

Web API â€“ Acts as the data source, streaming real-time events/data.

Apache NiFi â€“ Handles data ingestion with easy flow management and routing logic.

Apache Kafka â€“ Provides a scalable and fault-tolerant messaging layer for real-time streaming.

Apache Spark with Scala â€“ Consumes Kafka streams, performs real-time data processing and transformation using DataFrames.

Local Storage â€“ Stores the final transformed data locally for quick access or further analysis.

ðŸ“Š This setup ensures low-latency processing, scalability, and modularity, making it suitable for real-time analytics or monitoring solutions.
